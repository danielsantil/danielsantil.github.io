Writing about yourself is always challenging, isn't it? But I'll give it my best shot.

My name is Daniel Santil. I was born and raised in the heart of the Caribbean, in my beloved Dominican Republic.

I have 9+ years of experience as a software engineer, primarily as a backend developer, though I've been involved with frontend development for a significant time as well.

While I don't claim to know EVERYTHING about every tool, framework, or language, I constantly find myself researching best practices, improving codebases, striving to keep code clean and readable, and supporting my teammates.

Of course, I love challenges â€” whether it's developing something from scratch or connecting some obscure legacy system with whatever modern solution is required. Count me in!

Beyond software development, I'm passionate about music and play the guitar. I've participated in multiple musical projects with some of the leading Christian artists in Latin America. I'm also proud to have co-founded and currently run a record label company based in Miami.

I love traveling, meeting new people, and immersing myself in different cultures. These experiences continue to shape both my personal and professional perspectives.
