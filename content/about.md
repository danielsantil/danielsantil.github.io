This is where I start writing about myself... kind of a hard task already, huh? But I'll do my best.

My name is Daniel Santil. Born and raised right in the middle of the Caribbean, in my beloved Dominican Republic.

I have 5+ years working as a software engineer, mainly as a backend developer, although I've been fully involved with frontend development lately... And hey, it's not that scary after all!
<br/>
That being said, I still lean towards backend development, I guess I prefer being in the shadows. :)

Well, let me break this down; Most likely I won’t know EVERYTHING about a specific tool, framework, language, etc., but I always find myself reading about best practices, improving my code base, trying to keep it clean and readable, and assisting teammates.
<br/>
Of course, I love challenges, developing something new, connecting some weird legacy system with, I don't know, whatever is required? Sign me up!

Oh, did I mention that I also play the guitar? I don’t consider myself a pro (not even close TBH), but let’s see how it turns out.
<br/>
I also like traveling, meeting new people and exposing myself to different cultures.


OK, enough!! Geez!!!
